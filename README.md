## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- A Supabase account (free tier available)
- A Google OAuth application setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-bookmark-app.git
cd smart-bookmark-app
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be ready
3. Go to Settings > API to get your project credentials:
   - Copy your `Project URL`
   - Copy your `anon public key`

### 3. Configure Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application)
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for local development)
   - `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/auth/callback` (for production)
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
7. In Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to Authentication > Providers
   - Enable Google provider
   - Paste your Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Create Database Schema

1. In Supabase, go to SQL Editor
2. Create a new query and paste the SQL from `supabase/migrations/001_create_bookmarks_table.sql`
3. Run the query

### 5. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 6. Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Features in Detail

### Authentication
- Users sign in with their Google account
- OAuth handled securely via Supabase
- Session persisted automatically
- Automatic redirect to bookmarks page on login

### Bookmark Management
- **Add**: Simple form with URL and title validation
- **View**: Paginated list of bookmarks with domain names and timestamps
- **Delete**: One-click delete with confirmation
- **Real-time**: All changes sync instantly across all open sessions

### Real-time Synchronization
- Powered by Supabase Realtime with PostgreSQL LISTEN feature
- Uses WebSocket connections for instant updates
- Subscribe to changes specific to the logged-in user
- No page reload needed - bookmarks appear instantly

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users only see their own data
- All queries filtered by `auth.uid()` on the database level
- Public anon key safe to expose in frontend
- Private user data never exposed to other users

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: CORS Issues with Supabase
**Issue**: Initial development had CORS errors when trying to connect to Supabase from localhost.

**Solution**: 
- Ensured the Supabase URL and anon key were correctly configured
- Used Supabase's built-in CORS support (already configured by default)
- Made sure we were using the correct library (`@supabase/ssr` for proper App Router support)

### Problem 2: Real-time Subscriptions Not Working
**Issue**: Bookmarks weren't updating in real-time when added from another tab.

**Solution**:
- Verified that Row Level Security (RLS) policies were enabled on the bookmarks table
- Ensured the `supabase_realtime` publication included the bookmarks table with `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE bookmarks;`
- Used proper channel naming with user-specific filters: `channel('bookmarks:${userId}')`
- Tested with browser DevTools to confirm WebSocket connection was established

### Problem 3: Auth State Not Persisting
**Issue**: Users were logged out after page refresh during development.

**Solution**:
- Switched from deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` to `@supabase/ssr` package
- Used proper session handling in Next.js App Router
- Implemented proper `getSession()` calls in `useEffect` to check authentication state

### Problem 4: Tailwind CSS Not Loading
**Issue**: Styles appeared broken after initial setup.

**Solution**:
- Verified Tailwind CSS was properly installed during Next.js project creation
- Confirmed `globals.css` had Tailwind directives
- Made sure build process was restarted

### Problem 5: Google OAuth Redirect URI Mismatch
**Issue**: Got "redirect_uri_mismatch" error during Google sign-in flow.

**Solution**:
- Verified exact redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matched the app redirect
- Used `window.location.origin` to build dynamic redirect URIs for different environments
- For local dev: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- For production: `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/auth/callback`
- Added both to Google OAuth configuration

### Problem 6: npm Package Installation Issues on Windows
**Issue**: npm install failed with permission and tarball corruption errors due to OneDrive path length issues.

**Solution**:
- Used `npm cache clean --force` to clear corrupted cache
- Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` for better dependency resolution
- Moved project to a shorter path if needed
- Used `Remove-Item -Recurse` to properly clean up node_modules before retry

## Deployment to Vercel

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with the code (public or private)
- Vercel account linked to GitHub

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Smart Bookmark App"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - In Environment Variables, add:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key
   - Click Deploy

3. **Update Google OAuth Redirect URI**
   - Once deployed, get your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://smart-bookmark-app.vercel.app`)
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Add `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/auth/callback` to authorized redirect URIs

4. **Update Supabase Settings**
   - In Supabase, verify site URL is set to your Vercel URL
   - Update redirect URLs in Authentication settings if needed

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyXxxx...
```

### Optional
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Override site URL for auth redirects (useful for preview deployments)

## API Routes

This app doesn't use API routes. All database operations go directly through Supabase client libraries with proper RLS policies protecting data.

## Database Schema

### Bookmarks Table
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `user_id` (UUID) - References auth.users(id)
- `title` (VARCHAR) - Bookmark title
- `url` (TEXT) - Bookmark URL
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Last update timestamp

### Security Policies
- Users can only SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE their own bookmarks
- Enforced via RLS policies at the database level
- No need for backend authorization logic

## Performance Optimizations

- Real-time subscriptions use efficient WebSocket connections
- Database indexes on `user_id` and `created_at` for fast queries
- Component-level state management prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Images/assets served from CDN via Vercel

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Bookmark categories/tags
- [ ] Search and filter functionality
- [ ] Bulk import/export
- [ ] Bookmarks sharing (with permission controls)
- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Bookmark statistics and analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Bookmarks not syncing in real-time?
1. Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled in Supabase
3. Confirm the bookmarks table is in the `supabase_realtime` publication
4. Try clearing browser cache and refreshing

### Can't sign in with Google?
1. Check if Google OAuth credentials are correctly configured
2. Verify redirect URI matches exactly in both Google Cloud and Supabase
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
4. Ensure Google+ API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

### "User not authenticated" errors?
1. Clear browser cookies and local storage
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Verify session is being retrieved with `getSession()`
