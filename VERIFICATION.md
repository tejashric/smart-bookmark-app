## Feature Verification

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User visits http://localhost:3000 ✓
2. Redirected to Google OAuth consent ✓
3. After authorization, redirected to /auth/callback ✓
4. Code exchanged for session ✓
5. Redirected to /bookmarks ✓
6. Session stored in browser ✓
7. On refresh, session retrieved and user remains logged in ✓
```

### Real-time Synchronization
```
1. User signs in on Tab 1 ✓
2. User signs in on Tab 2 with same account ✓
3. Add bookmark in Tab 1 ✓
4. Bookmark appears in Tab 2 instantly (< 500ms) ✓
5. Delete bookmark in Tab 2 ✓
6. Bookmark disappears from Tab 1 instantly ✓
```

### Privacy Enforcement
```
1. Sign in as User A in Browser 1 ✓
2. Add bookmarks as User A ✓
3. Sign in as User B in Browser 2 (different Google account) ✓
4. User B cannot see User A's bookmarks ✓
5. User A cannot see User B's bookmarks ✓
6. Data isolated at database level (RLS) ✓
```
